Lexical:
AF_INET     - AddrFamily_INTERNET
SOMAXCONN   - Socket Maximum connection: constant 128 represents max accpted queued connections before rejection in socket backlog
SOL_SOCKET  - Socket Level: constant that specifies the option being set only applies to the socket itself
SO_REUSEADDR - Socket Reusable Address: allows a socket to bind to an address that is in a TIME_WAIT state from a previous connection.


Setting up the server:
    Server initiation: 
        1. set socket (AF_NET, SOCK_STREAM)
        2. set_opt
        3. bind to fixed socket to port
        4. make it a listening Socket
        5. add socket to server class fds
    Loop poll:
        1. poll fds vector
        2. if revents & POLLIN -> check if newConnection or newMessage -> then add to socket to fds
    


poll() => check the status of an fd. once called, the poll() function checks all file descriptors at once during a single call.
            it returns 

launching server:

1. init com struct pollfd in which store
