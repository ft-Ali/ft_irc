CLIENT:

Nicknames are non-empty strings with the following restrictions:

They MUST NOT contain any of the following characters: space (' ', 0x20), comma (',', 0x2C), asterisk ('*', 0x2A), question mark ('?', 0x3F), exclamation mark ('!', 0x21), at sign ('@', 0x40).
They MUST NOT start with any of the following characters: dollar ('$', 0x24), colon (':', 0x3A).
They MUST NOT start with a character listed as a channel type, channel membership prefix, or prefix listed in the IRCv3 multi-prefix Extension.
They SHOULD NOT contain any dot character ('.', 0x2E).

CHANNEL :

Channel names are strings (beginning with specified prefix characters). Apart from the requirement of the first character being a valid channel type prefix character; the only restriction on a channel name
is that it may not contain any spaces (' ', 0x20), a control G / BELL ('^G', 0x07), or a comma (',', 0x2C) (which is used as a list item separator by the protocol).
There are several types of channels used in the IRC protocol. The first standard type of channel is a regular channel, which is known to all servers that are connected to the network. The prefix character for this 
type of channel is ('#', 0x23). The second type are server-specific or local channels, where the clients connected can only see and talk to other clients on the same server. 
The prefix character for this type of channel is ('&', 0x26). Other types of channels are described in the Channel Types section. 

To create a new channel or become part of an existing channel, a user is required to join the channel using the JOIN command. If the channel doesn’t exist prior to joining, the channel is created and the creating user becomes 
a channel operator. If the channel already exists, whether or not the client successfully joins that channel depends on the modes currently set on the channel. 
For example, if the channel is set to invite-only mode (+i), the client only joins the channel if they have been invited by another user or they have been exempted from requiring an invite by the channel operators

IRC servers may also define other levels of channel moderation. These can include ‘halfop’ (half operator), ‘protected’ (protected user/operator), ‘founder’ (channel founder), and any other positions the server wishes to define. 
These moderation levels have varying privileges and can execute, and not execute, various channel management commands based on what the server defines.

The commands which may only be used by channel moderators include:

KICK: Eject a client from the channel
MODE: Change the channel’s modes
INVITE: Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)
TOPIC: Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel
Channel moderators are identified by the channel member prefix ('@' for standard channel operators, '%' for halfops) next to their nickname whenever it is associated with a channel (e.g. replies to the NAMES, WHO, and WHOIS commands).
